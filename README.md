# Word_Embeddings
Side project that employs Continuous-Bag-Of-Words (CBOW) model for word embeddings. Different sizes of dataset is experimented on, with different computational layers, before conducting hyperparameter tuning to obtain best combination for each model. Each model is then tested on intrinsic and extrinsic evaluators to test performance.

## File Descriptions
- 'Word_Embeddings_01.ipynb': Downloading of dataset and preprocessing to obtain the various dataframes for use.
- 'Word_Embeddings_02.ipynb': Trains and evaluates each model, and tested on the various evaluators.

# Note
The entire project was intended to be completed in Google Colab for use of GPU, however, due to constant crashing and disconnection, 'Word_Embeddings_02.ipynb' was completed on Kaggle.
